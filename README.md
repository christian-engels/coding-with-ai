# Coding with AI

Welcome to the **FI5699 FI5698 Dissertation Module Programming Environment**. This repository contains resources and code for your dissertation module. Importantly, you can start your coding environment from here.

## Getting Started

### Starting a Codespace

1. Click on the **Code** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. Select the + button to the right of Codespaces.

### Managing Your Codespace

**Important:** Codespaces consume computational resources and count towards your monthly usage limits. To avoid unnecessary usage:

- Stop your codespace when you're done working
- You have 120 core hours per month
- Active codespaces will automatically stop after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Stored codespaces are deleted after 30 days of inactivity

### Stopping a Codespace

1. In VS Code, click on the **Codespaces** tab on the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Click on the **Stop Current Codespace** option that appears from the dropdown.

## Workspace Structure

This repository contains several key directories for your work:

- `data/` - Contains data files including `ab_data.csv` and dataset documentation
- `python/` - Python notebooks and scripts, including examples of fixed effects analysis
- `r/` - R scripts covering tidyverse, time series, and fixed effects analysis
- `stata/` - Stata analysis files and utilities

## Getting Help

Each programming environment comes with built-in AI assistance via GitHub Copilot. As you code in Python, R or Stata, Copilot will provide contextual suggestions and help.

## Saving Your Work

A convenience script `save-work.sh` is provided to quickly save and push your changes. Use this regularly by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run Code".

Feel free to explore the example files in each language folder to see common analysis patterns and coding practices.

Enjoy your coding journey!
